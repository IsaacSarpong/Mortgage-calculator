# Shift Digit Image in Python
In this project, we will be shifting a digit image up, down, left, and right using Python. We will use the OpenCV library for image processing and manipulation.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run this project:

OpenCV
NumPy
You can install the libraries using the following commands:

pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy

## Image Dataset
We will be using the MNIST dataset for this project. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits and is widely used for image classification tasks.

To download the MNIST dataset, you can use the following command:


wget https://github.com/myleott/mnist_png/raw/master/mnist_png.tar.gz
After downloading the dataset, extract it using the following command:

tar -zxvf mnist_png.tar.gz
The extracted folder will contain two subfolders, training and testing, which contain the images for training and testing respectively.
